            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The Ford Bronco is a model line of sport utility vehicles manufactured and marketed by Ford. The first
                SUV
                model developed by the company, five generations of the Bronco were sold from the 1966 to 1996 model
                years.
                A
                sixth generation of the model line is sold from the 2021 model year.The nameplate has been used on other
                Ford
                SUVs, namely the 1984–1990 Bronco II compact SUV and the 2021 Bronco Sport compact crossover.</p>

        <div id="column2">
            <h2>About 6th Gen</h2>
            <p>The new Bronco two- and four-door models go on sale in summer 2021—pushed back from the spring due to the
                challenges brought on by the pandemic. Prices start at $29,995 for the two-door and $34,695 for the
                four-door, including a $1,495 destination charge. Most of the seven trim levels have rather evocative
                names, such as Big Bend ($34,860), Black Diamond ($37,505), Outer Banks ($40,450), Badlands ($43,550),
                and Wildtrak ($48,435). A limited-production First Edition ($58,865) will be available at launch.

                Ford describes the base model as being rather bare-bones, with the idea that buyers could personalize it
                from a catalog of more than 200 components. It is worth noting that even this version can be fitted with
                the Sasquatch package that brings a serious roster of hardcore off-road equipment.

                Like previous generations, the sixth-generation Bronco will be built at Michigan Assembly Plant in
                Wayne, Mich. </p>

            <h2>Orders</h2>
            <p>Reservations are open now for $100. Ford advises that Bronco order banks will now open in mid-January
                instead of Dec. 7, as originally planned, and reservation holders will begin ordering in mid-January.
